# computer_science_curriculum

this is a computer science learning path to lay down the fundementals for a beginner or person new to computer science. The curriculum is as follows:
  - CS I: essentials to programming, this includes topics that are fairly simple yet are the fudementals to computer science. We will go over printing to STDOUT, getting input from STDIN, data types, variables, arrays, if-else statements, switch statements, for and while loops, and the different operators in the course's programming language.
  - CS II: growing on your newfound skills, this course will go over slightly more complex topics that are essential to any computer scientist. these include methods/functions, exception handling, importing libraries , classes, recursion, searches, sorts, and other common algorithms.
  - CS III: honing your skills in the field of computer science, this course will go over data structures, object orientated programming, functional programming, parrallel programming, and files.
